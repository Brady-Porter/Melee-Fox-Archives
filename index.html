	<h2>
		The goal of this page is to collect the widely scattered information on how to play fox in super smash bros melee, categorized in a manner best suited for people learning the character. In effect, I want this to be the same kind of page as something like alexspuffstuff is for puff or like melee.guru/marth is for marth, but without dwelling so much on general concepts of learning and competitive psychology, as I feel like these subjects have already been beaten into the ground in the melee community. I will still have some resources for these subject in the external resources section (probably sub-divided into the stuff that gets referenced by everyone like The Art of Learning and The Inner Game of Tennis and stuff that doesn't get recommended everywhere for the people that've already seen all of that and want to dig deeper), but I want the focus to instead be on just collecting information and ideas and letting the reader decide how to use it for themselves.

<div class="content">
  <p>Aspects of the neutral game, primarily relating to which tools are effective for accomplishing which goals and how certain tools relate to the mental model of the game you're playing with (more on that in mental models).</p>

	<h2>
		Punish:
	</h2>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Open</button>
<div class="content">Some of this will be more general ideas of what works in certain situations, but more often this will probably just be a place to put the spreadsheets I sometimes make to find out *exactly* what moves can extend combos in exact character/stage/percent combinations. Ideally this can be referred to for answers to niche questions like: "what follow ups to shine are true against Luigi?", or "what's the percent at which shine stops being a true follow-up from nair against falco?". This will all run under the assumption that your opponent is doing "peak human SDI", as pretty much nothing is technically confirmed when you're talking about TAS-perfect SDI.

	<h2>
		Matchups:
	</h2>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Open</button>
<div class="content">I take a lot of notes on matchups whenever I do reviews of my matches, so I will use this to collect the ideas I get about certain matchups that I felt were succint enough to be worth sharing.
	</div>
	
	<h2>
		Mental-Models:
	</h2>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Open</button>
<div class="content">This refers to the ways that you can conceptualize your gameplans; concepts like bait-and-punish, character archetypes (and character archetype matchups), or bubble theory. This is definitely the most vague, nebulous sub-section, so it will probably end up a lot less useful to the people looking for highly specific data and more useful to people looking for the bloggier style you might see from other character resources.
